# Boomerang Artifact Evaluation

This is the artifact which was evaluated for the paper Boomerang: Demand-Driven Flow- and Context-Sensitive Pointer Analysis for Java which is published as part of the ECOOP 2016 conference. It is a bundle to be able to evaluate soundness and precision of the Boomerang, SB[1] and DA[2]. In addition to that the artifact can be used to run it on arbitrary Android applications.

There is more information on how to run the artifact [available here](https://github.com/johspaeth/boomerang-artifact/wiki).
